    "- Use `_v1`, `_v2`, etc., for major changes  \n",
    "- Use `_v1.1`, `_v1.2` for small tweaks or improvements  \n",
    "- Keep final versions clean, e.g., rename to `train_model.py` once finalized\n",
    "\n",
    "🔁 **Versioned filenames help you:**\n",
    "- Quickly go back to a working version  \n",
    "- Avoid overwriting important changes  \n",

    "📌 Why Use Plural?\n",
    "- **Clear intention**: Plural names indicate multiple items are stored, making it easy to identify collections.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Makes your code and project structure easy to understand, maintain, and scale.\n",
    "- **Clarity in navigation**: It’s easier to navigate through a project where directories and dictionaries reflect their contents.\n",

    "- **Ease of Use**: Makes navigating through the project easier, especially in larger codebases.\n",
