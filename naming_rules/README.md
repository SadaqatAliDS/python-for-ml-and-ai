# Project Naming Conventions - Best Practices

This repository documents naming rules and best practices for Python projects. These conventions ensure clarity, consistency, and easy collaboration.

## üîπ Naming Rules

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Descriptive Names  
Use meaningful names that clearly describe the content or purpose of the file (e.g., `load_data.py`, `train_model.py`).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Lowercase with Underscores  
Follow `snake_case` for Python file names. Avoid capital letters, spaces, and hyphens (e.g., `data_loader.py`).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Keep Names Relevant  
Names should match the actual functionality or content of the file.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Follow a Consistent Naming Convention  
If you use a format like `verb_noun` (e.g., `clean_data.py`), stick to it across all files.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Use Version Control in File Names  
Add versioning for changes (e.g., `data_cleaning_v2.py`, `model_v1.py`) to track script evolution.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid Special Characters and Spaces  
Only use letters, numbers, and underscores. No spaces or symbols (e.g., `process_data.py`, not `process data!.py`).

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid Reserved Keywords and Built-in Function Names  
Don‚Äôt name files or variables after Python keywords or built-in functions like `input`, `list`, or `print`.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Use Limited Length  
Keep names short but informative. Avoid overly long filenames that reduce readability.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid Starting Names with Numbers  
Python identifiers can‚Äôt start with numbers (e.g., use `model_1.py` instead of `1_model.py`).

### üîü Use Plural Forms for Collections, Dictionaries, and Folders  
Plural names indicate that a file/folder holds multiple items (e.g., `users_list.py`, `datasets/`, `scripts/`).

### üî∏ Use README.md in Each Folder  
Each folder should contain a `README.md` describing its purpose and contents. This helps with clarity and collaboration.

## üí° Why These Rules?

Following these practices:
- Improves **readability** and **collaboration**
- Keeps the codebase **organized**
- Reduces confusion and **errors**
- Prepares the project for team scaling and **open-source contribution**
